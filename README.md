# 3D-SFS
*Detecting positive selection from multidimensional site frequency spectra.*

## Set up

### To install

	git clone https://github.com/lpmdiaz/pop3D
	cd ./pop3D

### To compile

**Windows users** Can use CodeBlocks software to run and compile .cpp file.

**Mac users** Use XCode.

Would recommend using a virtual machine.

**Unix users**

	g++ -Wall 3D_SFS_to_log_likelihood_ratio.cpp -o CLRT


## Use

### To run the main script

The 3D global SFS file must be called "ms.3d.sfs", the 3D windows SFS file must be called "ms.3d.windows.sfs"; the program will automatically output the selection test result for each window in a file called "composite.log.likelihood.ratio".

	./CLRT 

### Plotting

**CLRT**
The *plotclrt.R* file takes the output of *pop3Dclrt* as an input and plots the CLRT in a pdf. This script takes in arguments the input CLRT file and the output pdf name (note: the extension will be added by default), as well as the pdf width and height parameters. Example:

	Rscript plotclrt.R clrt CLRT 14 7

This command will create the *CLRT.pdf* file containing the plotted CLRT.

**3D SFS**
First need to use the *parse3Dsfs.cpp* program to make a file the R script can use. Parameters are input file, output name, and the three population sizes.
Input 3D SFS, output pdf name without extention, then angles phi and theta.


	Rscript plot3Dsfs.R parsed3Dsfs 3Dsfs 40 40

### Rscript

	Rscript clrt3pop.R Data/ms.3d.windows.sfs Data/ms.3d.sfs > CLRT.txt
